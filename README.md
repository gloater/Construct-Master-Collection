# Construct-Master-Collection
This is the dedicated repository for the Construct :: Master Collection developed by ChadoriXD「茶どり」. 
You can post here the feature requests and bug issues you want to officially file. 
But do please verify first on the official Discord Server.
Invite Link : https://discord.gg/eS3HK88

# Tip
Always verify from the Discord Server before posting here, to help with the filter.
This benefits both customer and developer. 
So, if ever this is a bug, i am already oriented with the situation since we already discussed this in realtime.
If ever not, i could even maybe help you with the problem and tell you that the tool or addon is not the plugin
and i could direct you to the right direction. In realtime.

# Sending a Bug Report
You can send a bug report here once you have validated the feature from the Discord Server.
Please always include the steps to reproduce the issue with a demo project.
If you don't, it most likely will be closed because, it's time consuming to manually make a demo project
myself, which i'm not even sure if there is a bug to find.

# Sending a Feature Request
You can send a feature request here once you have validated the feature from the Discord Server.
If not, i might have to either close it if i'm not compelled.
Or, if it catches my attention, it might become a less prioritized because i wasn't orientated.
So, it's really better to verify from the Discord Server beforehand.
Then, i will be the one to inform if you can post it here.

# Express Feature Requests
These are paid orders so these will be be given top priority.
You don't have to post here. I will manage express orders.
Once the payment and request have been verified, i will post here the order
and i will work on it as soon as possible.

Welcome to my repository.
Thank you for supporting my addon collection.
Have a nice day.
